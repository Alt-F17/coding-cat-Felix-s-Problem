Write a function `can_form_triangle(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> bool` that takes three positive integers representing side lengths and returns `True` if they can form a valid triangle. 

A triangle is valid if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side.

**Hint**: Youâ€™ll need to check all three combinations of two sides.
