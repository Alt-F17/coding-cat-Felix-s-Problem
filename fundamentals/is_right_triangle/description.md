Write a function `is_right_triangle(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> bool` that takes three side lengths and returns `True` if they form a right triangle.

A right triangle satisfies the Pythagorean Theorem: the square of the longest side must equal the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

For example:
- `3, 4, 5` forms a right triangle (since 3² + 4² = 5²).
- `5, 12, 13` is also a right triangle.
