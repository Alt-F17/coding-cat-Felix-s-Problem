Write a function `difference_is_even(a: int, b: int) -> bool` that takes two integers and returns `True` if the absolute difference between the two numbers is even, and `False` otherwise.

**Hint**: Solve [Is Even](/#/problems/is_even) and [Calculate Absolute](/#/problems/calculate_absolute) first.
