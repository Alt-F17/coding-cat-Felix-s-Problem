A network of weather sensors records temperature readings every hour. Due to sensor glitches, sometimes readings suddenly jump or drop drastically between consecutive hours.

Your task is to identify off readings. We consider what is an off reading when the temperature
jumps more than 10 degrees compared to the last reading. Identify which indices are potential
sensor anomalies
