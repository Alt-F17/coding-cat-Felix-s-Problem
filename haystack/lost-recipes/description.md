A famous chef, Tace T, lost their recipe notes! All that remains is a messy list of ingredients, with multiple duplicates and some combined ingredient descriptions.

Your job is to recover the original recipe by extracting unique ingredient names from this list. The list may include slight variations in ingredient naming (e.g., "chopped onion" vs "onion"), but for now, just collect the distinct exact ingredient strings, ignoring duplicates. The chef prefers to see the ingredients in the order they first appeared.

Be careful to ignore irrelevant notes scribbled among the ingredients.
