Every year, at Sunnyville Elementary, the teacher hands out birthday cards numbered from 1 to N — one for each student. This year, the cards got mixed up on the way to class. Some cards went missing, and some mysterious extra cards with weird numbers showed up.

Now, the teacher has a pile of cards but can’t tell which students actually got their birthday wishes and which ones got skipped or got the wrong cards. It’s a bit of a mess!

The teacher wonders if you can help figure out which birthday card numbers didn’t make it to the pile — and make sure no strange cards sneak in pretending to belong.
