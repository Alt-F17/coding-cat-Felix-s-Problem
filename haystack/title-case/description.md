You’re an intern at the Museum of Curiosities, a quiet, slightly eerie building tucked away between two embassies and an abandoned planetarium. Your job, technically, is “Digital Labeling and Cataloguing Assistant,” though what that means changes hourly.

Today, the curator handed you a USB stick labeled “DO NOT OPEN — FINAL EXHIBIT TITLES.” Naturally, you opened it. Inside: a plain text file of exhibit names — dozens of them, all in lowercase. This wouldn’t be a problem, except that the museum is opening tomorrow, and the plaque engraver refuses to work with “low-effort input.”

“I expect proper titles,” she snapped. “Real ones. Like in a book. Capitalize the first word. The last word. The important ones in the middle. But don’t go capitalizing every little connector. That’s just shouting.”

You asked for clarification. She just muttered something about “the spirit of curation” and left.

Here’s one example you’re supposed to fix:

    "a study of the insects beneath forgotten floorboards"

She said she wants that one to look like how it would appear in The New Yorker — “but less pretentious.”

Your task is to write a program that fixes the problem.
