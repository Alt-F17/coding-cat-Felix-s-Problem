In a windswept chamber beneath the desert, nestled among calcified wires and rusted gears, your team discovers Artifact IX-42: a circular stone plate covered in copper channels, each inscribed with a sequence of numbers.

At the center lies a compass-like spindle surrounded by a ring of integers:
`[17, 42, 8, 23, 5, 91, 34]`

Nearby, scratched hastily into a metal panel, a cryptic message reads:

    “Spin the dial n clicks to reveal the path. Those who read it straight are doomed to wander.”

You begin to suspect the original sequence isn’t meant to be read as-is. Several attempts to decipher the numbers yield nothing — until a junior researcher casually turns the plate two positions clockwise. Suddenly, the numbers align to match entries from an old navigation chart.

The array seems rotational — numbers shift around the circle, and those pushed past the edge loop back to the start. Depending on how many clicks (n) you rotate it, the pattern transforms.

Now, your challenge: determine the correct reordering of the sequence based on a given number of clockwise shifts. Only then can the Compass Array reveal its message.

Time is short. The chamber is collapsing. The correct orientation might be your way out.
