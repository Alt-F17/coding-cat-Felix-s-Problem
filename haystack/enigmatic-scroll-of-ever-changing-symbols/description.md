Deep in the forgotten ruins of Linguistica, explorers discovered an ancient scroll filled with strange symbols that seem to shift and shimmer. One moment a symbol looks like a fiery rune, the next it morphs into a watery glyph — and sometimes it even doubles back on itself!

The ancient linguists are baffled: they know the true secret lies hidden in the longest sequence of symbols that never repeat — but with symbols constantly shape-shifting, no one can quite tell which are truly duplicates.

Your puzzling task is to decode the scroll and find that longest stretch of apparently unique symbols — if you can figure out what counts as “unique” before the scroll changes again!
