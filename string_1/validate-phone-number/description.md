Write a function `is_phone_number(s: str) -> bool` that returns `True` if `s` is a valid Northâ€‘American phone number **without loops**.  
Accept either of these formats only:

* 10 consecutive digits, e.g. `"5145551234"`
* Digits separated by single hyphens: `"514-555-1234"`

The string must contain exactly 10 digits and, if hyphens are present, they must appear after the 3rd and 6th digit.
