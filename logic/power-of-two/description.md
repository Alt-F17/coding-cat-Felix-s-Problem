Write a function `power_of_two(n: int) -> bool` that takes an integer n and returns True if it is a power of 2, and False otherwise.

A number is a power of 2 if it can be written as 2^k for some non-negative integer k. For example:
- 1 (2^0), 2 (2^1), 4 (2^2), 8 (2^3), etc. are all powers of 2.
- 0, 3, 6, 10, etc. are not.

**Hint**: Use a loop to check if the number is a power of 2.
