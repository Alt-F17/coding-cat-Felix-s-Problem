Write a function `palindrome_number(n: int) -> bool` that returns True if the integer n is a palindrome, and False otherwise.
A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. 

For example:
- 121 is a palindrome
- 1331 is a palindrome
- 123 is not a palindrome

**Hint**: You can convert the number to a string to easily reverse and compare it. Negative numbers are not considered palindromes.
