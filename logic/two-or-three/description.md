Write a function `two_or_three(n: int) -> bool` that takes an integer n and returns True if the number is a multiple of 2 or a multiple of 3, but not both.

For example, 6 is a multiple of both 2 and 3, so the function should return False. But 4 is a multiple of 2 only, and 9 is a multiple of 3 only, so both should return True.
