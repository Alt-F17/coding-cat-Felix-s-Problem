Write a function `majority_wins(a: bool, b: bool, c: bool) -> bool` that takes in three boolean values and returns the value that appears at least twice.

In other words, return True if two or more of the inputs are True, and return False if two or more are False.

**Hint**: You can convert booleans to integers to help count them.
